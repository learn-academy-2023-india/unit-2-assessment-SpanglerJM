# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: ks

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter, in ( ) for our variable is a piece of information to be calculated in our code, i think of parameters as the numbers you punch in a calculator before you hit solve. an argument is a value used in your method if you call it. and maybe you dont have to call it? like it can sit there, waiting to be invoked and do its function at any time like an assassin

Researched answer: A parameter would be the variable used in my function. and argument is pretty much what i said

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: an opbject is what we control and change in a class? like the coffee exercise was, Coffee was the class of drinks we were talking about but the myCoffee was the object to be manipulated depending on the code order we set. a class is our 'blueprint' to make objects. we have a class of Coffees and all the different objects are the different orders we made

Researched answer: an object is an instance of a class, like a category and a class is a blueprint for creating objects

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: a repeated action, answer or function i guess, anything that repeats in our code. I think a for loop would classify as an iteration. theres probably other examples of cooler ways to iterate and more efficient wasy of looping than our foundational for-loops i would be happy to learn.

Researched answer: repeatedly executing a set of statements or a block of code. just  repeating the number of times i set

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: without looking it up, hoist meaning to lift or rise with force, here it might mean a fuction that hightens a class or block of code to be a higher priority than it normally would be in the order of coding? for some reason we forgot that a block of code needs to be executed highter order so hoise the code so we dont need to go and change the previous code? and itll send these arguments or whatever to the top of the list

Researched answer: variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase - so i think i was pretty close there

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: it is a structure that is used to store data within a react component.

2. React Props: is a pipeline where data brhavior can pass from one  component to a nested component through invocation.

3. JSX: the combination of HTML and JavaScript. a syntax extension of JS used with React.
